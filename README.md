## About The Project

Even though there are many great networking libraries across our community, you still have to develop your own networking layer around it, which might be great for customization in the long run but demands some good effort in the beginning. This project intends to assist you in both. It provides an out of the box networking layer that can still be well customized for your own needs, and since it was developed using [Moya](https://github.com/Moya/Moya), you may use it its features as well [Alamofire's](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire).
